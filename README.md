# recursion
Ruby recursion method implementations: Display Fibonacci Sequence, and merge sort

##  Overview

This project is from The Odin Project series, and is a simple practice mechanism for recursive methods. Each method has been created along an accompanying helper method (such as `display_merge_sort(array, expected_array, test_msg)` to more easily test and display specific calls on the methods.

## Methods

* `fibs(n)` : Uses iteration to create the first "n" elements of the Fibonacci Sequence.

* `fibs_rec(n)` : Uses recursion to create the first "n" elements of the Fibonacci Sequence.

* `merge_sort(array)` : Uses recursion to sort an array (strings, numbers, etc...).
